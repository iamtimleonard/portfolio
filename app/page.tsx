            <p>
              I began making websites for fun with friends in elementary school,
              when table-based layouts were all the rage. Somewhere in the
              depths of the internet there is an archive of the geocities site I
              made to review video games. Currently, I am a full stack engineer
              at Epoxy.ai, where I collaborate with a team of experienced
              engineers to create personalization tools in the sports betting
              space. While there, I gained experience designing and building
              scalable web applications with AWS. I have been enjoying getting
              my hands dirty with cloud native architecture. Previously, I
              worked at 21PSTEM, a non-profit specializing in education
              technology for STEM classrooms. There, I worked directly with
              educators and researches to build applications for use in math
              classes. That work tied in well with my own history as an educator
              and public school teacher.

              I began my journey as a self-taught web developer. To hone my
              skills, I took part in projects with chingu.io, where I was
              grouped with other web developers across the world to build
              projects together. I got to work on some interesting projects with
              equally interesting people - a standout was a mushroom locator
              app. It taught me a lot about software design and working as a
              team of developers.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an earlier life, I was a professional cellist, freelancing in
              New York City, and a public school music teacher in Warren
              Township, NJ, where I taught instrumental music.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also an avid rock climber, shape note singer, mycologist, and
              Seinfeld fan.

            I am a full stack developer with a passion for the future of the
            web. Currently, I work at Epoxy.ai, where I collaborate with a team
            of experienced engineers to create personalization tools in the
            sports betting space. While there, I gained experience designing
            building scalable web applications with AWS. I have been enjoying
            getting my hands dirty with cloud native architecture.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            Previously, I worked at 21PSTEM, a non-profit specializing in
            education technology for STEM classrooms. There, I worked directly
            with educators and researches to build applications for use in math
            classes. That work tied in well with my own history as an educator
            and public school teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my journey as a self-taught web developer. To hone my
            skills, I took part in projects with chingu.io, where I was grouped
            with other web developers across the world to build projects
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an earlier life, I was a public school teacher in Warren
            Township, NJ, where I taught instrumental music, and a freelance
            cellist in New York City.
          </p>
          <p>Skills: TypeScript, AWS, React, Redis, MongoDB, SQL, Ember.js</p>
          <p>
            I am also an avid rock climber, shape note singer, mycologist, and
            Seinfeld fan.

            , I worked on a project called EnCOMPASS, which fell under the
            purview of{" "}
            <Link href="https://mathematicalthinking.org/">
              Mathematical Thinking
            </Link>
            . The purpose of the project is to encourage student collaboration
            in the learning process. When using the app, students are able to
            view one anothers' math work and leave comments for each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the sole developer on this legacy project, it was my
            responsibility to define features, architect solutions, and to
            assign priority to stakeholder requests. My main efforts there were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              update the legacy codebase to modern JavaScript, including
              migrating to Ember 3
            </li>
            <li>improve the main dashboard UI</li>
            <li>develop a set of data visualizations for instructors</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I learned a ton during my time at 21PSTEM.</p>
